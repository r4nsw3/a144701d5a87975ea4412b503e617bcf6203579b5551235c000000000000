  |   Once every 300 years, the Rise of Morastrum threatens the existence   |
  |   of our world. All born in that year are doomed to perish before its   |
  |   end. However, there came a time when a sole child did survive. He     |
  |   was using the power of death to conquer the world. Yet one day, he    |
  |   vanished. Another 300 years passed, and again a child defied fate.    |
  |   She came to be known as the Matriarch. It has been 300-odd years      |
  |   since the appearance of the Matriarch. Humanity now stands at the     |
  |   fulcrum between hope and despair. Will there be another child of      |
  |   destiny?                                                              |
